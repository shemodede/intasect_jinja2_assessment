# intasect_jinja2_assessment


Hi, thanks for the opportunity to work on this assessment.

Just a few pointers on how to set up the project and get it running:

The project was built/based on the flask framework with the Jinja template engine as required.

The packages needed to run the project have been included in the *requirements.txt* file.

To begin, a virtual environment would have to be set up, followed by the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command. The packages should quickly install and the project will then be ready to run.

To spin up the project, I used the following command `flask --app app --debug run`.


The project has a *Register* and a *Login* tab on the navbar, both lead to pages for registering and logging a user in respectively.

Once a user registers, they are able to log in and view/modify their user credentials.

Users can also add *Tyre*, *Vehicle*, *Chassis Types* and *Tyre Location* information from the *Records* dropdown.
Once the records are populated, the user can the view the *Tyre Journey* page to inspect the average number of days a set of tyres has spent on a vehicle.

Should you be in need of any clarification please feel free to reach out. Thanks.
